# Reviewpad Integration Test

Integration tests are conducted on a complete system to verify that its components interact as expected. They are commonly necessary to check communication between components, such as an API and its related services, as well as to test the system as a whole. Unit tests, on the other hand, are used to evaluate the basic features of a single component, like a single function or class. Unit tests are usually used to make sure individual components are functioning correctly, while integration tests are used to make sure the system works properly as a whole.
