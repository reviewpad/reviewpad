# Reviewpad

**If you think Reviewpad is or could be useful for you, come say hi on [Discord](https://reviewpad.com/discord)!**

## What is Reviewpad?
Reviewpad is an open-source tool to automate pull request workflows.

The workflows are specified in a YML-based configuration language described in the [official documentation](https://docs.reviewpad.com/docs/intro-to-reviewpad).

In Reviewpad, you can automate actions over the pull requests such as:
1. Automated [comments](https://docs.reviewpad.com/docs/comment-on-pull-requests);
2. Add or remove [labels](https://docs.reviewpad.com/docs/;automatic-pull-request-labelling);
3. Specify [reviewer assignments](https://docs.reviewpad.com/docs/automatic-reviewer-assignment);
4. Automate [close/merge actions](https://docs.reviewpad.com/docs/auto-merge).

As an example, the following workflow:

```yml
api-version: reviewpad.com/v1.x

labels:
  ship:
    description: Ship mode
    color: 76dbbe

rules:
  changesToMDFiles:
    kind: patch
    description: Patch only contains changes to files with extension .md
    spec: $hasFileExtensions([".md"])

workflow:
  - name: ship
    description: Ship process - bypass the review and merge with rebase
    if:
      - rule: changesToMDFiles
    then:
      - $addLabel("ship")
      - $merge()
```

Automatically adds a label `ship` and merges pull requests that only change `.md` files.

You can execute Reviewpad through the CLI or through the Reviewpad [GitHub action](https://github.com/reviewpad/action).

## Architecture
This repository generates two artifacts:

1. CLI [cmd/cli](cmd/cli/main.go) that runs reviewpad open source edition.
2. Reviewpad library packages:  
    ├ github.com/reviewpad/reviewpad/collector  
    ├ github.com/reviewpad/reviewpad/engine  
    ├ github.com/reviewpad/reviewpad/lang/aladino  
    ├ github.com/reviewpad/reviewpad/plugins/aladino  
    ├ github.com/reviewpad/reviewpad/utils/fmtio  

Conceptually, the packages are divided into four categories:

1. Engine: The engine is the package responsible of processing the YML file. This process is divided into two stages:
    - Process the YML file to determine which workflows are enabled. The outcome of this phase is a program with the actions that will be executed over the pull request.
    - Execution of the synthesised program.
2. [Aladino Language](https://docs.reviewpad.com/docs/aladino): This is the language that is used in the `spec` property of the rules and also the actions of the workflows. The engine of Reviewpad is not specific to Aladino - this means that it is possible to add the support for a new language such as `Javascript` or `Golang` in these specifications.
3. Plugins: The plugin package contains the built-in functions and actions that act as an abstraction to the 3rd party services such as GitHub, Jira, etc. This package is specific to each supported specification language. In the case of `plugins/aladino`, it contains the implementations of the [built-ins](https://docs.reviewpad.com/docs/aladino-builtins) of the team edition.
4. Utilities: packages such as the collector and the fmtio that provide utilities that are used in multiple places.

## Development

### Compilation

We use [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/). To compile the packages simply run:

```sh
task build
```

To generate the CLI of the team edition run:

```sh
task build-cmd
```

This command generate the Reviewpad CLI `main` which you can run to try Reviewpad directly. The CLI has the following argument list:

```sh
./main --help
Usage of ./main:
  -dry-run bool
        Dry run mode
  -github-token string
        GitHub token
  -mixpanel-token string
        Mixpanel token (optional)
  -pull-request string
        Pull request GitHub url
  -reviewpad string
        File path to reviewpad.yml
```

### Debugging on VSCode

Add the following to your `.vscode/launch.json`.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch CLI",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "debug",
            "args": [
                // Flag to run on dry run
                "-dry-run",
                // Absolute path to reviewpad.yml file to run
                "-reviewpad=_PATH_TO_REVIEWPAD_FILE_",
                // GitHub url to run the reviewpad.yml against to
                // e.g. https://github.com/reviewpad/action-demo/pull/1
                "-pull-request=_PULL_REQUEST_URL_",
                // GiHub personal access token
                // https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
                "-github-token=_GIT_HUB_TOKEN_",
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/cli/main.go"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Contributing

We welcome contributions to Reviewpad from the community!

There are multiple ways to contribue from answering questions in the discussions, opening new [issues](https://github.com/reviewpad/reviewpad/issues) and contributing to the codebase.

If you need any assistance, please join [discord](https://reviewpad.com/discord) to reach the core contributors.

### Development Policy

Our development policies are explicitly formalized in the [Reviewpad.yml](https://github.com/reviewpad/reviewpad/blob/main/reviewpad.yml) file.

We use short-lived feature branches and pull requests to introduce changes to the codebase.

Reviewpad will take care of most of the automation so that 90% of the pull requests do not stay open for longer than a few hours (even for outside contributors).
